## Neovim Configuration

For my Neovim setup, I use [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), a minimal, performant, and extensible configuration thatâ€™s easy to personalize and optimized for modern workflows.

## WezTerm Configuration

My WezTerm settings are available in my [Dotfiles repository](https://github.com/binbingoloo/.dotfiles). These configurations aim to enhance the terminal experience with a focus on performance and usability.
