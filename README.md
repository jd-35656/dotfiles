# JD's Dotfiles

## Neovim Configuration

My Neovim setup is inspired by [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim). It's a minimal, fast, and flexible configuration thatâ€™s easy to extend while providing a modern and efficient development environment.

## WezTerm Configuration

The WezTerm configuration in my dotfiles is inspired by the setup from [binbingoloo's dotfiles](https://github.com/binbingoloo/.dotfiles), customized to suit my workflow with performance and usability in mind.
